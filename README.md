In this project I've covered several important topics:

- Creating custom classes from scratch.
- Understanding and implementing both UICollectionView and UITableView.
- Using UIImagePickerController.
- Working with UUID for generating unique identifiers.
- Utilizing FileManager's appendingPathComponent() method.
- Learning about UserDefaults for reading and writing user preferences.

## Extra (not required by the project):
- I added the addGestureRecognizer method to experiment with handling long-press gestures.
